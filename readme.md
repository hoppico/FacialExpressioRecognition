# Facial Expression Recognition via CNN

In this project, I have implemented a convolutional neural network to recognize facial expressions using images. I used some image processing technique to improve the accuracy of the recognition.

I implemented this project with the assistance of one of my student at Saudi Arabia. We have an accepted paper on the scientific idea, and it will be published soon.
